# Prototype Autonomous AI Agent for Trading Solana Memecoins

## Overview

Welcome to the **Prototype Autonomous AI Agent for Trading Solana Memecoins**! This initial version is designed to explore the possibilities of automating the trading of memecoins on the Solana blockchain, specifically using platforms such as [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun) and [Raydium](https://raydium.io). The aim of this prototype is to provide a foundation for future development and experimentation in trading strategies leveraging the inherent volatility of memecoins.

> **Note:** This is a **prototype** implementation and not a production-ready system. Use this tool for educational and experimental purposes only.

## Features

- **Real-time Market Analysis:** The AI agent continuously scans the memecoin market on Pump.fun for price spikes and potential trading opportunities.
- **Automated Trading:** Executes buy and sell orders on Raydium based on predefined criteria and algorithms.
- **Risk Management:** Implemented basic strategies to mitigate losses, including a simple stop-loss mechanism.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can modify various parameters to tailor the agent's trading strategy according to their individual risk tolerance.
- **Dashboard for Performance Tracking:** Basic console output for monitoring trade statistics and agent performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.60 or higher
- A Solana wallet with SOL for transaction fees
- Accounts on Pump.fun and Raydium to integrate with the agent

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-memecoin-ai-trader-rust.git
   cd solana-memecoin-ai-trader-rust
   ```

2. Ensure you have **Cargo** (Rust package manager) installed. Install dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your API keys and wallet details. For example:

   ```plaintext
   SOLANA_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   PUMP_FUN_API_KEY=your_pump_fun_api_key
   RAYDIUM_API_KEY=your_raydium_api_key
   ```

2. Modify the configuration file `src/config.rs` to adjust trading parameters such as:

   - Minimum trade amount
   - Risk appetite (risk/reward ratio)
   - Trading strategies (momentum, arbitrage, etc.)

### Running the Agent

To launch the trading agent, execute the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Usage

Once the agent is running, it will start analyzing the Solana memecoin market and executing trades based on its algorithm. Outputs will be displayed in the console, allowing you to monitor its activity and performance. It is essential to regularly evaluate the agent's performance and adjust parameters as needed.
